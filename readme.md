script2package
==============

script2package is a Python script which converts a single python script into a package which can then be installed via `python setup.py install`.

Usage: `script2package script.py --base base_folder`

To extend the flexibility of this package, you can enable setup options through
providing `setup.cfg` if you so desire.
